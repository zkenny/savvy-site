As of Q1 2021, the economy is recovering, but the extraordinary interventions by the Federal Reserve and the federal government have driven both stocks and bonds to record highs.  Moreover, the extraordinary level of money printing and stimulus spending also threaten to stimulate a resurgence of inflation.  These factors create a very challenging investment climate.

These would include broad diversification, with significant allocations to such as international equities and commodities, and may also include dynamic allocation strategies, long/short complementary asset strategies, and hedged income strategies.
