But in the chart below it's inescapably clear that Market Capitalization has expanded far beyond the economy.  The current ratio (as of March 15, 2021) is at a record high of 190%.  This eclipses by far the prior high of 143% set during the dotcom bubble of 2000.  And the implication of this stratospheric valuation is that market prices would have to fall nearly 50% just to get back to the long term average.  But even worse, once a major decline sets in, fear takes hold and typically drives prices well below average, as can be seen in the chart following the 2000 and 2008 bear markets.\",\r\n    p3:\r\n        'Moreover, complacency and overconfidence are also at very high levels and serve as further warning signs.
