From there we can run a variety of financial forecasts, that you can experiment with as well. The platform also provides budgeting tools, and offers an optional data aggregation service. Data aggregation allows you to link all of your financial accounts to your planning account, which then provides for real time monitoring of how your financial position is evolving over time.";function B(){return i.a.createElement(s.a,{activeTab:"planning"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__page-content"},i.a.createElement(l.a,{title:f,size:"lg"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__intro"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__intro-text"},i.a.createElement("div",null,f),i.a.createElement("ol",null,i.a.createElement("li",null,h),i.a.createElement("li",null,v),i.a.createElement("li",null,b),i.a.createElement("li",null,y),i.a.createElement("li",null,_))),i.a.createElement("img",{className:"planning__intro-img",src:"../images/planningGears.jpg",alt:"gears"}))),i.a.createElement(l.a,{title:E,alignment:"center",size:"md"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__intro-to-planning-content"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__intro-to-planning-text"},i.a.createElement("div",null,w),i.a.createElement("div",null,N)),i.a.createElement(d,{className:"planning__intro-to-planning-button"},x))),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__subsection"},i.a.createElement("img",{className:"planning__subsection-img",src:"../images/balancesheet.png",alt:"balance sheet example"}),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__subsection-content"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__subsection-title"},T),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__subsection-text"},k),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__subsection-text"},z))),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__subsection"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__subsection-content"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__subsection-title"},P),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__subsection-text"},j),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__subsection-text"},D)),i.a.createElement("img",{className:"planning__subsection-img",src:"../images/survivorscenario.png",alt:"financial planning survival scenario"})),i.a.createElement(l.a,{title:F,alignment:"center",size:"md"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__planning-tech"},i.a.createElement("div",{className:"planning__planning-tech-text"},O),i.a.createElement("img",{className:"planning__right-capital",src:"../images/rightcapital.jpg",alt:"right capital example"})))))}}}]);
